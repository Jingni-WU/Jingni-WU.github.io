Hey there! My name is Jingni and I'm a graduate of the [Computational Linguistics program at Georgetown University](https://gucl.georgetown.edu/).

My research interests lie in computational discourse modeling, information theory, and NLP for social good. I‚Äôm passionate about applying linguistic insights to the development and evaluation of language models, especially in the context of AI safety and bias detection. I aim to contribute to building linguistics-motivated, transparent, and efficient NLP tools.

I'm currently collaborating with [Professor Amir Zeldes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Grvf4zYAAAAJ&hl=en) on my graduation research paper titled "*Unpacking Ambiguity: The Interaction of Polysemous Discourse Markers and Non-DM Signals*" for the [CODI CRAC workshop at EMNLP 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/codi-crac2025/home). In this project, we employed Shannon Entropy --- a fundamental concept in information theory --- and statistical modeling to quantify the "ambiguity" of discourse markers and other signals which mark discourse relations. We're also working together on the [DISRPT 2025 Shared Task](https://sites.google.com/view/disrpt2025/), where we aim to develop more efficient systems for discourse relation parsing and classification.

Outside of school, you'll probably find me making a weirdly shaped bowl at the pottery studio or decorating my bullet journal. I'm also a big fan of learning new languages --- in addition to being fluent in Japanese and English, I've been studying French for two years and am taking Korean courses. Always love to learn more!

‚ù§Ô∏è Favorite projects
------
* *04.2024-05.2024* [Baby LM challenge](https://babylm.github.io/). We used small and children speech-like dataset to train language models, aiming to use smaller dataset and lighter architecture to get better model performance. Besides, we evaluated our final model in diverse language tasks, including reading comprehension, grammar learning, paraphase detection, etc. 
* *03.2024-04.2024* [Gender Balanced Dataset Creation and Assessing Gender Bias in Existing Coreference Systems](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hh_0t5loTUcSzUddosUqAnpdK7YlIEdVZtHYGFXWuHU/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p). We curated a dataset where we replaced all gender pronouns with the gender-neutral 'they' and probed the gender bias in several coreference models. It's interesting to notice that coreference models are indeed biased but prefer male / female pronouns differently. We presented the dataset for future model training and evaluation. 


<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
